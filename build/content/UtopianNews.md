This page was inspired by my youngest son and his love for History alternative history. This was supposed to be the news paper for the fictional Utopian Country.

It was create to simulated a newspaper web-site. For the layout I used the CSS Grid model. I also learnt a bit more about Javascript specifically about date formatting. I know this can be done with libraries such as _moment_ but I wanted to try by myself.

It terms of responsiveness a lot can be improved and also the html structure needs to be change in order to be easier to style it.
