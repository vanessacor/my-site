On my third project for [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). where I was asked to _“build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch”_ to flex my DOM manipulation skills.

At the top the user chooses the size of the grid and how many squares per line before they start paining. Once the mouse hovers over the grid-container, the squares are _painted_. The user can choose color-off mode and the squares will be in gray scale or color-on mode and the colors are randomized

To display the squares I used the CSS Grid model. I learnt a lot about DOM manipulation like appendChild, setAttribute, set style and classes.

I believe now that this type of project would work better if was built with canvas, but onl later I found it out that you can literally draw with javascript.

I had a lot of fun with this one and hope you enjoy it.
