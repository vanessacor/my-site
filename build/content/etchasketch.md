On my third project for [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). where I was asked to “build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch” to flex my DOM manipulation skills. I also learn CSS grid. I had a lot of fun with this one and hope you enjoy it.
