On my third project for [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). where I was asked to _“build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch”_ to flex my DOM manipulation skills.

At the top the user chooses the size of the grid, how many squares per line, and once the mouse hover over the grid-container squares are _painted_. The user can choose color-off mode and the squares will be in gray scale or color-on mode.

To display the squares I used the CSS Grid model. I learnt a lot about DOM manipulation like appendChild, setAttribute, set style and classes.

I believe that this time of project would work better if was created with canvas.

I had a lot of fun with this one and hope you enjoy it.
