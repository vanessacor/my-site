This another assignment for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). Although I was asked to create a game that would be played on the console. I decided that this was a chance for me to integrate everything I had learned to that point. I build this game using CSS and JavaScript. I am really proud of myself and have to thank the help of Andre and the coaches from [CodeBar Barcelona](https://codebar.io/barcelona).
