This another assignment for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). I was asked to create the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors that would be played on the console. I decided that this was a chance for me to integrate everything I had learned to that point. I build this game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It user versus computer. The user first makes his choice by cliking in one of the three icons, a time out is trigger so the user has the "feeling" of time. The result for the round is display on the left is the user choice and on the right the computer. The score is update. When one of the player reaches 5 points the game is over and winner is announced. A reset button is displayed and user can start a new game.

I learnet so much javascript doing this project. I remember how hard it was for me to understand some of the core concepts of JS (arguments, parameters, template literals) and after this project I felt like suddenly evertyhing made sense (well not everything).

If I was asked today to do this project again I probably would made some changes, I definetly would separate the business logic from UI logic.

I am really proud of myself and have to thank the help of Andre and the coaches from [CodeBar Barcelona](https://codebar.io/barcelona).
