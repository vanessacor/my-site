When I decided to learn web-development, I found the Odin Project and decided to do the [Web development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). The first assignment was to clone the Google Homepage, it was a very simple exercise but I remember how much I enjoy seeing my work on the web-browser.
I did project to practice what I had learnt on my first assignment: git/GitHub - create a repository, clone, add, commit and push; HTML - structure and semantics, elements, tags, attributes; CSS - elements, selectors, declarations, properties and values;
