When I decided to learn web-development, I found the Odin Project and decided to do the [Web development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). The first assignment was to clone the Google Homepage, it was a very simple exercise but I remember how much I enjoy seeing my work on the web-browser.

Build simple a page using all I had learn on the first modules of Odin Project Course: Git/GitHub - create a repository, clone, add, commit and push; HTML - structure and semantics, elements, tags, attributes; CSS - elements, selectors, declarations, properties and values

Web page with just HTML and CSS using google fonts and fontawesone icons. I try to do the simplest thing and play a bit with the colors gradient and box-shadow.

When I started this page my goal was also to document my learning journey weekly but for some reason I got too hooked to the coding and didn't made time for the writing.
