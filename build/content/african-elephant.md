Create another static webpage to consolidate my learning of HTML and CSS.
I built an info page (content from wikipedia) about one of my favourite animal.

Because I started learning JavaScript following the curriculum in the Odin Project, I decided to include a go to top button with JS. I looked at examples and adapted to my page.

Looking at the code I definetly should used less div and id's. It was hard for, I think sometimes still is, to know when to apply classes and ids.
