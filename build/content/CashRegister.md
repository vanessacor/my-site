The challenge was to build a cash register for a imagenary coffee shop. The user can choose a category from a set list, enter a description and the price (amount).
The items are add to a list and the total amount is sum. The user can then delete items from the list.

- DOM manipulation (create an element, set attribute, add class)
- JavaScript (arrays, events, scope, functions)
- Separate business logic from UI (event handlers, update dom) code
