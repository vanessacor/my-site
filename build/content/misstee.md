After doing the canvas tutorial, I decide to adventure on making my own canvas html game! It takes inspirations in our lovely and sweet cat Misstee.

#### Annoying bug

It is a challenge to debug in canvas because a lot things happen at the same frame. I had this very annoying bug, it seemed that at some random times you would loose all the lives at once or your points would go 20 at once. It took a while to figure it out, because it didn't happen everytime, it looked so random. It turn out to be a very simple mistake that I made in a array.splice method.
