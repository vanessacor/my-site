I want to create an web-page where I would be able to apply my new CSS skills, namely responsive and mobile first approach.

I decided that a photo galery of my instagram photos would be a good project. Photo Galery is a very simple and responsive webpage.

Things I have learnt:

- HTML (best practices)
- CSS (flex box model)

Things I would do different now:

- I would try to use instagram API to update this page everytime I posted something on my Inst account.
