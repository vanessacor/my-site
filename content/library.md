After finishing the front-end module of the 101 web-development I jump into the [JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript). This was the first project my first experience with Object-oriented programming - OOP.

The challenge was to create a simple library app. The user can add books with its title, author, genre and status. Users can delete and edit books.
I used the behavioral test driven approach for the business logic.

#### What have I learnt:

- JavaScript - objects and object constructor, properties and methods.

#### What I would do differently:

- [This](https://pacific-hamlet-13856.herokuapp.com/catalog).
