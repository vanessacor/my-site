After learning the basics of node.js and express with this tutorial, I decided to rebuild [My Library](https://vanessacor.github.io/site/experiments/library/) now with node.js, express, EJS and MongoDB.

- JavaScript - promises, ES6 best practices;
- SASS - best practices, variables, mixins.

#### What I would do differently:
