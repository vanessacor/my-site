This was another assignment for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). I was asked to create the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors that would be played on the console. I decided that this was a chance for me to integrate everything I had learned to that point. I built this game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It's a user versus computer game. The user first makes their choice by clicking in one of the three choices, and then a timeout is triggered so the user has the "feeling" of time. The result for the round is displayed and the score updated. When one of the players reaches 5 points the game is over and the winner is announced. A reset button is displayed so the user can start a new game.

I learnt so much javascript doing this project. I remember how hard it was for me to understand some of the core concepts of JS (arguments, parameters, template literals) and after this project I felt like suddenly everything made sense (well... maybe not everything).

I am really proud of myself and have to thank the help of Andre and the coaches from [CodeBar Barcelona](https://codebar.io/barcelona).

#### What I have learnt:

- JavaScript - conditional operators, functions (declaration, parameters and return value), arrow functions, loops, template literals, set time out;
- CSS - media-queries,

#### What I would do differently:

- I definitely would separate the business logic from UI logic, that's a distinction that I wasn't aware of at the time
