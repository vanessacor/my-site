For my final project at [Factoriaf5](http://www.factoriaf5.org/), I had the opportunity to build a webpage was for Caritas de S. Josep de Badalona with the technical support from [Basetis](https://www.basetis.com/).

The goal of this project was to build an institutional webpage for Caritas to display information about [Tarjetas Monedero project](https://www.caritas.es/accion_social/un-nuevo-modelo-de-entrega-de-alimentos/) and to allow them to manage the content in multiple languages. 

The application was developed within 4 sprints of one week each by a team of 5 people: [Alvaro Taboada](https://github.com/raykotab), [Gabriel Reyna](https://github.com/G4BR1TRZ), [Giacomo Corso](https://github.com/pilpod), [Rene Flores](https://github.com/renejfc). As a team we decided to split into two groups, a frontend and a backend one, and everyone switched groups after the second sprint.

We followed the Scrum framework, starting the day with a daily and ending each sprint with a demo followed by the retrospective meeting. We used pair programming and occasionally mob programming as tools for collaboration. We adopted [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) with a development branch and a branch for each feature.
