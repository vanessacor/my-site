This was my final project for [Factoriaf5](http://www.factoriaf5.org/). The project was for Caritas de S. Josep de Badalona with the technical support from [Basetis](https://www.basetis.com/).

The aim of this project was to build an institutional webpage for the Caritas to display information for [Tarjetas Monedero project](https://www.caritas.es/accion_social/un-nuevo-modelo-de-entrega-de-alimentos/).

The Project was developed within 4 sprints of one week each. My team of was a team of 5 people: [Alvaro Taboada](https://github.com/raykotab), [Gabriel Reyna](https://github.com/G4BR1TRZ), [Giacomo Corso](https://github.com/pilpod), [Rene Flores](https://github.com/renejfc), and we decided to split into two teams:  a frontend team and a backend team, everyone switched teams after the second sprint.

We followed the scrum framework, starting the day with a daily and ending each sprint with a demo, followed by the retrospective meeting.
As a team we adopted [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), we had the development branch and each feature was developed in its own branch. We use pair programming and occasionally mob programming as tools for collaboration.

The project was developed following the test driven development approach.
