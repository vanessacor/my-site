A web app to keep track of the books on your bookshelf.
This feels like I reach the end of a cycle. This is my first full stack project!
It's built with the MERN stack.

On the backend, I built a Restful API, you can check it [here](https://github.com/vanessacor/bookshelf-api).

On the frontend I built a React app using `create-react-app` and SASS.
This is my final version of a book library. I had previously done two similar projects:

- [My Library](https://vanessacor.github.io/site/experiments/library/) a static webpage built using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript, with no database.
- [My Books](https://pacific-hamlet-13856.herokuapp.com/catalog/book/list) a backend rendered website built with Node.js, Express, Mongoose and EJS, with a MongoDB database.

#### What I learnt:

- React - React Router, React DOM, React Developer Tools, JSX,
- RESTful API - Postman(testing),

#### What I would do differently:

- implement authentication session and authorization rules
- I would change the file structure to use the React conventions;
