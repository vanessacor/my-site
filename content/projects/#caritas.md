This was my final project for [Factoriaf5](http://www.factoriaf5.org/). The project was for Caritas de S. Josep de Badalona with the technical support from Basetis.

The aim of this project was to build the webpage for Caritas of S. Josep of Badalona for the Tarjetas Monedero project. The project requirements were:

- A webpage to display information about caritas S.Joseph that highlights the Donate Action.
- The webpage should have 3 main sections: Homepage, about and how to participate.
- Must have a call to action so users can easily find information on how to donate to the project.
- The application should serve as a template for other similar organizations.
- Must have a backoffice where the organizations can manage the content namely: contact details, bank account, About and How to participate sections.
- The design should mainly follow the style of Caritas, but customized in the details.
