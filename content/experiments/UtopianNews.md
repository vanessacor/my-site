This page was inspired by my youngest son and his love for History and alternative history. This is a newspaper website for the fictional Utopian Country.

The page has a header with a navbar, a main element with sections and articles and a footer with info about the newspaper.

#### What have I learnt:

- CSS: more Grid, more practice.
- Javascript: date formatting (I know it can be done with libraries such as _moment_ but I wanted to try it by myself).

#### What I would do differently:

- The design is a bit uninspired and it made it harder to actually practice.
- The html structure reflects this, I think I was a bit confused about what I was trying to achieve.
- In terms of responsiveness a lot could be improved.
