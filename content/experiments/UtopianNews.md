This page was inspired by my youngest son and his love for History and alternative history. This is a newspaper website for the fictional Utopian Country.

The page has a header with a navbar, a main element with sections and articles and a footer with info about the newspaper.

#### What have I learnt:

- For the layout I used the CSS Grid Layout.
- I also learnt a bit more about Javascript specifically about date formatting. I know this can be done with libraries such as _moment_ but I wanted to try by myself.

#### What I would do differently:

- In terms of responsiveness a lot can be improved and also the html structure needs to be changed in order to be easier to style it.
