When I decided to learn web-development, I found the Odin Project and decided to do the [Web development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). The first assignment was to clone the Google Homepage, it was a very simple exercise but I remember how much I enjoy seeing my work on the web-browser.
My goal was to build a simple Web page with just HTML and CSS using all I had learnt on the first modules of Odin Project Course. I tried to do the simplest thing and play a bit with the colors gradient and box-shadow. My goal was also to document my learning journey weekly but for some reason I got too hooked on coding and didn't make time for the writing.

#### What I have learnt:

- Git/GitHub - create a repository, clone, add, commit and push;
- HTML - structure and semantics, elements, tags, attributes;
- CSS - elements, selectors, declarations, properties and values;
- How to include google fonts and fontawesome icons.

#### What I would do differently:

- Design wise I probably would chose another color palette.
