Heard some much about React and how it is important today for a front-end developer to know how to work with. After searching for some tutorial I chose to follow [this great tutorial ](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact) by Bob Ziroll.
This simple page is a meme generator built with Create React APP, it takes two text inputs, to be displayed at the top and bottom of the image. The user has the choice to change the image randomly.

#### What have I learnt:

- React - props and state, components and class components, lifecycle methods, fetching data from API.
