The challenge here was to create a simple landing page with HTML, CSS and javascript, with some simple form registration.

I researched and learnt about landing pages, the good practices, what to include and how to include.

I created a fake Concrete Surfers community, inspired by one of my hobbies, skateboarding.

I imagined a simple page with the goal to build a community of people who like to skateboard and wanted to find other people to go out and skateboard together.

The page has a brief description of the community followed by the registration form for contact details. The page also displays some testimonies from trustees and at the bottom a video is displayed.

_note: Yes, it's me in the video almost crashing &#128515;._

#### What have I learnt:

- UI - whatâ€™s a landing page and best practices when creating one;
- HTML - DOM API;
- JavaScript - form validation, events listeners;
- CSS - positioning (place a play button on video element), flexbox,
