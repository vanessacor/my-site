The challenge was to create a simple landing page with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with a simple form registration.

I researched and learnt about landing pages, the good practices, what to include and how to include. I created a fake Concrete Surfers community, inspired by one of my hobbies, skateboarding. I imagined a simple page with the goal of building a community of people who like to skateboard and wanted to find other people to go out and skateboard together.

The page has a brief description of the community, followed by the registration form for contact details, some testimonies from trustees, and a video last.

**Note:** Yes, it's me in the video almost crashing &#128515;.

#### What have I learnt:

- UI: whatâ€™s a landing page and best practices when creating one.
- HTML: DOM API.
- JavaScript: form validation, event _preventDefault()_.
- CSS: positioning (how to place a play button on top of the video element), more flexbox.
