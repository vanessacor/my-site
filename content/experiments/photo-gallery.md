I wanted to create another web page where I would be able to apply my new CSS skills, namely, responsive web-design and mobile first approach.

I decided that a photo galery of my instagram photos would be a good project.

#### Things I have learnt:

- HTML - best practices
- CSS - flex box model

#### Things I would do different now:

- I would try to use instagram API to update this page every time I posted something on my Instagram account.
