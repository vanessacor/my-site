To finish my Javascript module of the [Web development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) I was asked to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This was my first project using BDD and although at first I struggled it helped me a lot to write the functions.

This online calculador has the basic math operators but it doesnâ€™t follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) meaning that all the operations are done by a pair of numbers being evaluated at a time.

#### What have I learnt:

- Separate business logic from UI (event handlers, update dom).
- JavaScript - arrays methods, loop and conditional statements, debugging (dev-tools), BDD using jasmine.

#### What I would do differently:

- I would try to implement PEMDAS and would add more complex operations.
