The final project of [Web development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) course was to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Based on my previous good experience separating bussiness logic from the UI behaviours, and knowing this project was a bit more complex, I took the time to do proper analysis and design the program before starting.

Having had heard about the benefits of TDD and looking at the many requirements of this app, I thought it was a glorious opportunity to practice it myself. I wrote all the tests first using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and this approach helped me a lot, not just because it forced me to document all the rules but also because it allowed me to test everything every time I did a small change.

#### What have I learnt:

- JavaScript: more array methods, loops, and conditional statements.
- Debugging: Chrome DevTools.
- TDD: writing unit tests with Jasmine.
