The final project of [Web development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) was to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This online calculador has the basic math operators but it doesnâ€™t follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) meaning that all the operations are done by a pair of numbers being evaluated at a time.

Again I design the program by separating the bussiness logic from UI logic.

On the business side, I first created the tests (behavior-driven development) using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/). Following this approach it helped me a lot to build all the functions and also the structure of the program. This side of the program is responsible to evaluate the expression and to return a result of that evaluation.

On the UI side the program is responsible for the event handlers and updating the DOM.

#### What have I learnt:

- JavaScript - arrays methods, loop and conditional statements, debugging (dev-tools), BDD using jasmine.

#### What I would do differently:

- I would try to implement PEMDAS and would add more complex operations.
