I was responsible for conducting risk assessments and producing safeguard plans in respect to the child's needs and their circumstances, working in a straight line with others community services.

I was also responsible for providing assistance for the family members regarding the child's welfare. I attended to court as requested to provide evidence in legal procedures.

I worked actively in several work-groups in which the main goal was to promote Children's Rights.

I organized workshops and training sessions for the new staff members and contributed in the design of documents templates used by the team.
