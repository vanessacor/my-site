This feels like I reach the end of a cycle.
My Bookshelf is my first fullStack project!
I built this React App almost from scratch (I use React Create app) and learnt the basics of working with React like React Router.
On the backend side, I created a Restful API using Node.js, express, mongoose.

#### What have I learnt:

- React - React Router, React DOM, React Developer Tools, JSX,
- RESTful API - Postman(testing),

#### What I would do differently:

-
