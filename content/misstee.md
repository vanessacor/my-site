After learning a bit on how to work with HTML Canvas, I decided to adventure myself on making my own canvas html game! The game takes inspiration from our lovely and sweet one ear cat Misstee and her love for shrimps.

The game is very simple, Misstee has to try to eat all the shrimps she can while avoiding the poisoned chocolates. As the game advances the number of shrimps and chocolates on the screen increase making it more difficult to play.

#### Annoying bug

It was a challenge to debug in canvas because a lot of things happen in the same frame. The game had this very annoying bug, it seemed that at some random times the player would lose all its lives at once or earn 20 points at once. It took a while to figure this out, because it seemed so random. It turned out to be a very simple mistake that I made in an array.splice method.

#### What have I learnt:

- JavaScript - drawing and animating on canvas. OOP, classes and methods.

#### What I would do differently:
