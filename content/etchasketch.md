On my third project for [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) I was asked to _“build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch”_ to flex my DOM manipulation skills.

This is a single page where at the top the user chooses the size of the grid, meaning how many squares per line before they start painting. Once the mouse hovers over the grid-container, the squares are _painted_. The user can choose between color-off mode (the squares will be in grayscale) and color-on mode (the colors are randomized).

I had a lot of fun with this one and hope you enjoy it.

#### What have I learnt:

- HTML - DOM API, append and remove elements, setAttribute, set style and classes;
- Javascript - DevTools to debug;
- CSS - CSS Grid Layout,

#### What I would do differently:

- I believe now that this type of project would work better if it was built with canvas, but only later I found it out that you can literally draw with Javascript.
