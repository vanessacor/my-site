        <p className="about-text">
          I was born in Portugal, lived in London and now I live in the
          beautiful city of Barcelona.
          <br />I studied psychology, worked for more than 5 years in the
          Portuguese child protection system, then moved to London where I
          worked in Adoption services and school support.
          <br />
          After moving to Barcelona with my family I decided to do a U turn in
          my career and started learning Web Development. I am a self-taught
          web-developer and I have learnt HMTL, CSS, Javascript, Node.js,
          Express, React and built along the way some fun projects.
          <br />I am currently looking to secure a challenging and rewarding new
          role within the web industry and continue to develop my skills
          further.
