          Here you will find all the projects I have done during my journey on
          how to code. Looking at all them itâ€™s like looking back and I feel
          that I want to redo all because I know I can do better now. But I
          decided not to change them because it tells my journey, it tells where
          I came from and how I got here. For every project I tried to do a
          retrospective and see what I have learnt in each one and what If I had
          to do it again what I would do differently.
