I had this very annoying bug, it seemed that at some random times you would loose all the lives at once or your points would go 20 at once. It took a while to figure it out, because it didn't happen everytime, it looked so random. It turn out to be a very simple mistake that I made in a array.splice method.</p>\n"},{"id":"11","title":"Canvas","link":"https://vanessacor.github.io/site/experiments/canvas/canvas-art/","image":"https://media-vanessapoppe-me.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/screenshots/canvasArt.png","tags":["HTML","Canvas","JavaScript"],"gitHubLink":"https://github.com/vanessacor/site/blob/master/experiments/canvas/canvas-art/script.js","date":"01/12/2020","description":"<p>Canvas is fun!
